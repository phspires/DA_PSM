# Goal
Implementation of Partial Least Square algorithm as well assessment measures of performance such as goodness of fitness, redundancy indexes and communalities. 
The algorithm was applied to a bank dataset in order to determine factors contributing to customer loyalty.
# Code structure 
The project implementation structure is described in further detail on this [file](https://github.com/phspires/DA_PSM/blob/master/DA_PLS_report.pdf).
