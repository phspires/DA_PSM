Implementation of Partial Least Square algorithm as well assessment measures of performance such as goodness of fitness, redundancy indexes and communalities. 
The algorithm was applied to a bank dataset in order to determine factors contributing to customer loyalty.
# Code 
In order to run the algorithm it is only necessary to run R file Run.R

The project implementation structure is described in further detail on
